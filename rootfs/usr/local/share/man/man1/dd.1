.Nm dd
.Nd convert and copy a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar operand...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
copies the standard input to the standard output. By default input data is
read and written in 64kB blocks. When finished,
.Nm
displays the number of records read and written as well as the total number
of bytes copied.
.Nm
syncs the filesystem once it is done copying. If you want to disable that use
the
.Ar nosync
option.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar bs Ns Op Ar =N
If
.Ar bs
is not specified, the default blocksize is 64kB. If
.Ar bs
is specified
without setting it to a specific value then an optimal value between the
source and target filesystem will be selected. If this process fails it will
fallback to the system's pagesize. Adjust
.Ar N
to set the block size of the transfers in bytes.
.It Ar count=N
Copy only
.Ar N
input blocks.
.It Ar direct
Use direct I/O for data.
.It Ar if=file
Read input from
.Ar file
instead of the standard input.
.It Ar nosync
Do not sync the filesystem once we are done copying.
.It Ar quiet
Enable quiet output.
.It Ar of=file
Write output to
.Ar file
instead of the standard output. If an initial portion of the output
.Ar file
is skipped using the seek operand, the output file is truncated at that
point.
.It Ar seek=N
Seek
.Ar N
blocks from the beginning of the output before copying.
.It Ar skip=N
Skip
.Ar N
blocks from the beginning of the input before copying.
.It Ar conv=notrunc
Do not truncate the output file.
