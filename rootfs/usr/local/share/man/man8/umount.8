.Nd unmount file systems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Ar target...
.Nm
.Op Fl fln
.Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
detaches the
.Ar target
filesystem(s). A file system is specified by giving the directory where it
has been mounted. Giving the special device on which the file system
lives may also work, but is obsolete, mainly because it will fail in
case this device was mounted on more than one directory.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds

All of the file systems described in
.Pa /proc/mounts
are unmounted. The proc filesystem is not unmounted.
.It Fl f
Force unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS server).
.It Fl l
Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the fs hierarchy now, and cleanup
all references to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore.
.It Fl n
Unmount without writing in
.Pa /etc/mtab .
